# Coronary_Heart_Disease_Prediction

This project aims to create a tool that can help healthcare professionals identify patients who may be at risk for heart disease. The project will use machine learning to predict the risk of heart disease based on a patient's medical history and demographics. The project also aims to raise awareness about the risk factors for heart disease and encourage individuals to make lifestyle changes to reduce their risk.

The project is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to make a significant impact on the prevention and treatment of heart disease.

Dataset has been uploaded. Code will directly run if the dataset and the code are in the same folder.
Install all the necessary modules before running the code.

I used stream-lit to build web user interface.

To Run the user interface, go to the directory of the project.
Run this command : streamlit run app.py

Input the values in the interface. It will predict and show the output.
